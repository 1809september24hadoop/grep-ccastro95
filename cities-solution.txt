--Comments: I was previously unaware of the regex that
specified the number of characters, but after figuring it out,
I was able to complete this. I was also previously unaware that
this required the egrep command.

grep -E '\<['[:punct:]'a-zA-Z]{14,}\>' cities.txt

#7
grep -c '^B' cities.txt

#8
grep -o 'd' cities.txt | wc -l

#9
--Comments: I was previously unaware of the regex \n, but after
figuring out that it basically duplicates what the nth
character was, I used this for the answer.

grep -E '(.)\1$' cities.txt

#10
--Comments: This one gave me a bit of trouble before I
completely understood the \n regex, but after a bit of work
I figured that you could use two \n regex's back to back as
shown below.

grep -Ei '^(.)(.)(.)\2\1$' cities.txt
